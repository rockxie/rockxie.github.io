We've got the results of one good testing board,it seems not very good,but sill can be accepted.We will receive more chips at next weekend if things are going well .

Results:

- Board:one chip testing board
- Frequency:360Mhz
- Volt:0.72V
- Hashrate per chip:11.52Ghash
- Power consumption:6.375W per chip
- Power consumption per Ghash:6.375/11.52=0.5539W/Ghash
- After power supply changeover:0.5539/81% = 0.684W/Ghash（at blade）
- Power consumption on wall:0.684/0.8 = 0.855W/G
	- Adding other components loss about 1KW/Thash

Tips:this result is not very accurate just for reference.
